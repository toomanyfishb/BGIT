# Anime Selecta

Anime Selecta is a simple web application that allows users to discover and explore anime based on various criteria. Users can browse through featured anime, view random anime suggestions, and read descriptions of selected anime.

## Features
- **Featured Anime:** Browse a curated list of featured anime.
- **Random Anime:** Discover random anime suggestions.
- **Anime Descriptions:** Read detailed descriptions of selected anime.
- **Search (Currently Not Functional):** Search for anime based on title or keywords (Note: This feature is currently under development and not fully functional).

## Usage
1. **Homepage:** Upon opening the application, users are greeted with the homepage featuring featured anime, random anime suggestions, and a search bar.
2. **Browsing Anime:** Users can click on anime cards to view detailed descriptions of selected anime.
3. **Randomize:** Clicking the "Randomize" button generates a new random anime suggestion.
4. **Search (Not Functional):** Users can enter search queries in the search bar to find anime based on titles or keywords. (Note: This feature is currently not functional).

## Challenges
While developing Anime Selecta, I encountered several challenges and problems:
- **Search Functionality:** Implementing the search functionality proved to be more complex than anticipated. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to get the search bar to work properly. As a result, this feature remains unfinished.
- **API Integration:** Working with the AniList API required understanding GraphQL and making POST requests, which presented a learning curve.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the application looks and functions well across various screen sizes posed a challenge, particularly in maintaining consistency and usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

Despite these challenges, I am committed to continuing development and improving Anime Selecta to provide users with a seamless anime discovery experience.
